# MinimaxAI-Tic-Tac-Toe
study of minimax algorithm and machine learning

This is a starting project of my independent study with Professor Badri Adhikari, the goal is to get familiar with AI Minimax algorithm and Alpha Beta pruning. 
Minimax algorithm is one of the well-known competing algorithms specifically for board game like Go, Connect-4, Tic-Tac-Toe etc.. I implemented the Tic Tac Toe 
game frame with open-source code that published on the internet, and I added my own functions which aimed to explain why and how AI places on the particular 
cells and keep itself unbeatable.
